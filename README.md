## :scroll: Description: 

This simple Team Profile Generator will take all of your employee's info and create an easily readble page. 


## :man_mechanic: Installation:

To install this app, you must clone the repo into a local file in your machine. You must have Node.js installed in order for this application to work (current version, not most recent). 


## :book: Usage Info:

To use this app, navigate into the folder that you cloned the repo into using your Terminal. (You can do this using an app like GitBash or directly inside of your code editor) Next, use the command 'node app' to initialize the set questions for you to answer. Complete all of the questions and when you are finished, a teamMembers.html file will be created inside the 'output' folder! (Use 'alt + b' in your code editor to open the HTML page in the browser.)
